\details{
In reality, there are many types of phenotypes such as continuous, ordinal, binary, category, etc.
For such phenotypes, there have been many researches to solve a multivariate regression problem.
For an analysis of high-dimensional genomic data with a single phenotype, the penalized regression has been widely used in many fields because it can fit a regression model for the multiple covariates at a time while accomodating correlations between predictors.
However, most of them focused on continuous phenotypes only, and the regularization approaches can depend on the tuning parameter selection which can be a challenging problem.
This package provides the selection probability for the case of multivariate phenotypes, which can prioritize variables given in a model regardless of tuning parameter selection.
Additionally, the empirical threshold is also provided to control the false positives(errors).
Thresholds vary with the expected number of false positives to be specified by the user.
Currently, this package contains three methods of unified elasitc-net (UNET), unified elastic-net with df-aggregating (UNET-df) and their comparing method, multiresponse elastic-net (MNET).
